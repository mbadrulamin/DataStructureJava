Welcome to my repository! Here, you will find a collection of Java programs focusing on various data structures. These programs were created during my studies as a means to gain a deeper understanding of data structures and their implementation in Java.

## Repository Highlights
- **ArrayList:** Explore my implementation of an ArrayList, a dynamic array that allows for flexible storage and manipulation of elements. This data structure is commonly used in Java programming for its versatility.

- **Bubble Sort:** Dive into my implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm, a simple yet fundamental sorting technique. This algorithm repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order until the entire array is sorted.

- **Doubly Linked List:** Discover my implementation of a Doubly Linked List, a data structure that consists of nodes with references to both the previous and next nodes. This structure allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and traversal of elements.

- **Insertion Sort:** Explore my implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm, which iterates through an array and gradually builds a sorted portion by inserting each element into its correct position.

- **Selection Sort:** Analyze my implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm, which repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the array and swaps it with the element in the correct position.

- **Singly Linked List:** Delve into my implementation of a Singly Linked List, a data structure in which each node contains a reference to the next node. This structure enables efficient insertion, deletion, and traversal of elements.

- **SinglyLinkedList From Scratch:** Get hands-on experience with my implementation of a Singly Linked List from scratch. This exercise allows you to understand the underlying mechanics and logic behind this commonly used data structure.

## How to Use this Repository
To make the most out of this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Explore the Code:** Take a closer look at the Java code provided for each data structure. Review the classes, methods, and variables to understand how the data structures are implemented and utilized.

2. **Experiment and Modify:** Feel free to experiment with the code, make modifications, and test different scenarios. This will deepen your understanding of how data structures work and how they can be customized to suit specific needs.

3. **Compare and Learn:** Compare the implementations of different data structures and sorting algorithms. Analyze their performance characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses. Consider how they can be applied to solve various programming problems.

4. **Contribute and Share:** If you have any suggestions, improvements, or additional data structure implementations, I encourage you to contribute to this repository. Your contributions can enhance the learning experience for others and foster collaboration within the programming community.

## Contributions
As an open-source repository, I welcome contributions from fellow programmers. If you find any bugs, have suggestions for improvements, or want to add new data structures or sorting algorithms, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Together, we can create a valuable resource for learning and practicing data structures in Java.

Happy coding!
